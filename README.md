# CODEALPHA-HANGMAN
The Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game built using Python on the task given by CODEALPHA as the part of internship. This version includes ASCII art based visual feedback, allowing users to visually track their progress or  the mistakes as they attempt to guess a randomly selected word.

Sanjay Shriram's Hangman Game

A fun and interactive text based Hangman game named after me built in Python, featuring ASCII visuals that update with each wrong guess  just like the classic game!

About the Project
This project randomly selects a word from a predefined list (including `"sanjay"`, `"shriram"`, `"code"`, `"alpha"`, `"python"`), and challenges the user to guess it letter by letter. The player has **6 chances** before the game ends, and each wrong guess reveals part of the hangman figure.
